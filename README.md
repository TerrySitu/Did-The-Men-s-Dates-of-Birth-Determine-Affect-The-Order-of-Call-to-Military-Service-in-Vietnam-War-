Did-The-Men-s-Dates-of-Birth-Determine-Affect-The-Order-of-Call-to-Military-Service-in-Vietnam-War?

On December 1, 1969, two lotteries were conducted to determine the order of call to military services in the Vietnam War. Men born between 1994 and 1950 are being “draw” from the lottery.
The main purpose of this paper is to find out whether the lottery is fair. In other words, did the birth dates determine/affect the order of call to military service in the Vietnam War? Or the lottery numbers were drawn randomly regardless of the dates of birth? Or can we predict the probability of a man’s lottery number by knowing his birthday?
